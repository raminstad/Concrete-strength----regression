# Analysis objectives
* Predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its age and ingredients
* Compare the performance of regression algorithms such as: linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, k nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and xgboost.
* The metric that will be used to identify thge best perfroming model is the cross validation MAE
* We will also use other metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R2 on train and test sets in order to detect overfitting
# Dataset that will be utilized
